       Popularly known as NSS, the scheme was launched in Gandhiji's Centenary year, 1969. The main aim of this scheme is to develop students' personalities through social/community service. NSS is a voluntary association of young people in Colleges, Universities, and at +2 level working for a campus-community linkage. The cardinal principle of the NSS program is that it is organized by the students themselves, and both students and teachers through their combined participation in community service, get a sense of involvement in the tasks of nation-building. Most of these camps are conducted in rural places or sub-urban areas. Their motto was simple Not me, but You.</p></div>
